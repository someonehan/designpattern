# Method is just a function object create by def statement
# method's works in exactly the same way as a single function, but there is one exception:
# a method's first argument always receives the instance object
# simple method :defined outside of a class, this function can access class attributes by
# feeding instance tag

# instance method: class method static method
# class method:is another called instance method, but inner working of instance method is the
# same as the class method, actually, python automatically maps an instance method call to a
# class method
# instance.method(args...)
# will be automatically converted to a class method function call like
# class.method(instance,args...)
